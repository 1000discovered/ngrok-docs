# How does ngrok work?

## Overview

ngrok operates a global network of servers called the _ngrok edge_ where it
accepts traffic to your upstream services from clients on the internet. The
URLs that it receives traffic on are your _endpoints_. You configure _modules_
that ngrok will use to authenticate, transform and accelerate that traffic as
it is sent to your upstream service.

Unlike traditional reverse proxies, ngrok does not transmit traffic to your
upstream services by forwarding to IP addresses. Instead, you run a small piece
of software alongside your service that we call an _agent_ which connects to
ngrok's global service via secure, outbound persistent TLS connections. When
traffic is received on your endpoints at the ngrok edge, it is transmitted to
the agent via those TLS connections and finally from the agent to your upstream
service.

You can choose how to run the agent software in different form factors. It's
lightweight and easy to install.

1. **As a service:** Run a small side process called the [ngrok agent](/agent/)
   as a background OS service.
1. **As an interactive CLI:** Run the [ngrok agent](/agent/) interactively from
   the command line while developing and testing.
1. **As an SDK embedded in your app:** Include a small [Agent SDK](/agent-sdks) library
   directly into your application software that returns a socket-like object.
1. **As a Kubernetes Controller:** Run our [Ingress Controller](/k8s/) in a
   Kubernetes environment.

## ngrok vs. Traditional reverse proxies

ngrok doesn't forward to IP addresses like traditional reverse proxies and
instead sends connections to your upstream service via a lightweight piece of
agent software running alongside or in your application.

This unique architecture confers several important benefits over the
traditional model.

First, it means you can run your services _anywhere_â€”any cloud such as AWS or
Azure, any application platform like Heroku, an on-prem data center, a Raspberry
Pi in your home, or even on your laptop.

Second, it allows ngrok to provide ingress with zero networking configuration.
You don't need to work with arcane networking primitives like DNS, IPs,
Certificates or Ports. That configuration is pushed to ngrok's edge and it is
all handled automatically for you.

Third, ngrok can protect you from attacks and enforce authentication without
the concern that someone could 'go around' ngrok by discovering your upstream
IP addresses.

## ngrok Concepts

ngrok has a number of concepts that it helps to understand. 

### Endpoint
An endpoint is a web address. Endpoints can be TCP, TLS, or HTTP/S endpoints depending on the applicable protocol. Any traffic sent to that endpoint will be routed based on how the endpoint is configured. Endpoints are served through our global 

### Edge

### Agent
The Agent can refer to two things. The first is a program runnning on a computing device that connects to the ngrok service and routes traffic to and from the ngrok service and a port on that computing device. This program can use ngrok's APIs, ngrok's SDKs (which use those APIs) and the Kubernetes Operator (wich uses the `ngrok-go` SDK). The Agent can also refer to the agent binary (also built using `ngrok-go`).

### Tunnel
Tunnels are the connections established between the Agent and the ngrok service. An agent can create multiple tunnels, but each one can only route traffic to a single port. A tunnel must be connected to an endpoint (either dedicated or ephemeral) or linked to an edge.

### Module/Policy/Middleware
Modules/Policies/Middleware tools to modify traffic that is sent to endpoints before it is routed to an agent.
